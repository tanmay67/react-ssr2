# react-ssr2
React application with server side rendering, and tried to implement data fetching through REST API.

installed webpack dev dependencies

installed babel dev dependencies

to work with them together we installed babel-loader

made two seperate files for config of Server side as well as Client Side

defines both of their Entry, target, modules, mode (The most important)

attached out client side to the server in server.js

defined dev scripts as well as production scripts to run

finally created the build folder, which converted all es5015+ and jsx code in basic javascript syntax
